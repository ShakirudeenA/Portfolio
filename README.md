## Ben's Pizzaria - January 2025 Branch Sales Report (NYC & PHL)

I built this project end-to-end using a synthetic but deliberately flawed sales dataset, with the approach of treating it as if it were commissioned with specific goals in mind. 	 

The raw CSV arrived with typical issues such as mixed formats, missing or inconsistent data, duplicate records and even simple typos.  These made for realistic data cleaning practice using MySQL. 

The next step was normalising the data and separating it from one large mess into well-organised, smaller tables with much less redundancy. 

The final step was uploading my normalised data into Power BI where it recognised table relationships and from there I built a series of visuals appropriate to the business context and objectives.

*In hindsight, I should've added a lot more columns to the original dataset to allow for a more interesting range of visuals.*

## Sales dashboard - Power BI

This dashboard presents key performance insights from 326 days of e-commerce activity, focusing on category sales performance.  
As it was an earlier project of mine, it lacked a professional finish - so I decided to clean it up.  Below are before and after screenshots.

## Cleaning and Preparing Data Using Pandas - Python

This dataset was collected from an individual’s smartwatch over the course of a month.  

The screenshot is a part of the process used to clean the data as well as my thought process and some data integrity challenges I faced.

### Data Integrity

To handle missing data in the Calories column, I used the mean of each workout duration (45 or 60 mins) rather than a flat overall average. This avoided skewing the data and kept the numbers realistic.  
The temporary mean of 305 were excluded from the calculations.

## Data Professional Survey – Power BI

This dashboard visualises insights from a survey of data professionals, covering their demographics, career paths, and industry trends.

This was my first Power BI project.  I followed a YouTube tutorial using a provided dataset. I will soon revisit
