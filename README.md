## 📌 Project Details

### 🍕 Ben's Pizzeria – January 2025 Branch Sales Report (NYC & PHL)
**Tools**: MySQL, Power BI  
I built this project end-to-end using a synthetic but deliberately flawed sales dataset, treating it like a real client brief.

- The raw CSV had issues like mixed formats, missing/inconsistent data, duplicate records, and typos — great for real-world data cleaning practice.
- Cleaned and normalised the data using **MySQL**, separating it into smaller, more structured tables.
- Imported into **Power BI**, used relationship detection, and built visuals aligned with business goals.

> **Lesson learned**: I should’ve added more columns to the original dataset to allow a broader range of visuals.

### 🛍️ Sales Dashboard – E-Commerce (Power BI)
**Tools**: Power BI  
This dashboard presents insights from 326 days of e-commerce activity, with a focus on category performance.

- Originally created early in my journey, the dashboard lacked polish.
- I later revised the layout and visuals for a cleaner, more professional presentation.

### ⌚ Smartwatch Fitness Data – Cleaning & Prep (Python)
**Tools**: Python (Pandas)  
Collected from an individual’s smartwatch over a month. Focused on cleaning and data integrity.

- Tackled missing values in the `Calories` column using **group-specific means** (based on workout duration: 45 or 60 mins), instead of a flat mean.
- This avoided skewing the results and kept the data more realistic.

> Temporary placeholder values (e.g. 305) were excluded from the calculations.

### 🧠 Data Professional Survey – Career & Industry Insights (Power BI)
**Tools**: Power BI  
A dashboard visualising survey responses from data professionals, including demographics, career paths, and industry trends.

- This was my **first Power BI project**, built by following a YouTube tutorial with a pre-cleaned dataset.
- I plan to revisit this and improve the design and storytelling.
